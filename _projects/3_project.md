This is a group project I am carrying out with two others as an extension of Purdue Space Program. The project is in its preliminary phases, as we are sizing the parameters of the engine and beginning CAD work. The hotfire date is currently set for mid-April.

Required Components
Electrical
Flow of propellants
Remote controlled valves (ball valves)
Pumps for nitrous
Data acquisition (DAQ)
Load cell
Pressure transducer (?)
Thermocouple (?)
Potentially put these two in a post-combustion chamber
Igniter
E-torches

Combustion Temperature (K): 3161.2136746204114
Throat Temperature (K): 2909.443171180999
Exhaust Temperature (K): 1803.9667316805908

Block Timeline
Design finished
Design reviews (mid February)
Purchasing (end of February)
Manufacture (March)
Launch prep/assembly (April 1)
Launch (April 25)

I will mainly be doing nozzle CAD, Data aquisition/sensor stuff (anything electrical), fluid flow through pumps and valves.
