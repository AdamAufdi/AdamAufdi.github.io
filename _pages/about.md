A highly creative and determined senior studying Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at Purdue University, with a specialization in propulsion. I am a lifetime learner, self starter, and multidisciplinary. I have a wide array of skills in mechanical and electrical engineering in addition to aerospace. I am primarily interested in propulsion, avionics, and aero/astrodynamics. I had a previous internship at Komatsu Mining, and I am currently doing research with Dr. Keith LeGrand in the Purdue Department of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. I have extracurricular experience leading a philosophy club, as well as working on liquid and hybrid rocket engines for Purdue Space Program and leading one of the top FIRST robotics teams in the world.

I am motivated by space travel and the prospect of exploring the universe, and I want to contribute in a meaningful way to making that possible. I am dedicated and have a strong work ethic, and do best when I am pushing myself to learn new skills and ideas. I want to solve hard problems and expand the boundaries human civilization.

I am skilled in most CAD programs (Solidworks, NX, Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, etc), FEA simulations, PLM/PDM workflows, experienced in Matlab, Python, and some C, able to operate 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and familiar with manufacturing standards and techniques, experienced in electrical system design, circuitry, and electrical schematic reading/writing, and PCB design. Through my various projects and activities I have developed experience and an intuitive feel for problem solving, root-cause analysis, failure analysis, and design iteration.
