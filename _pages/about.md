Senior studying Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at Purdue University. Highly creative and determined. I am a lifetime learner, self starter, and multidisciplinary. I have a wide array of skills in mechanical and electrical engineering in addition to aerospace. I'm interested in propulsion, avionics, and aero/astrodynamics. I had a previous internship at Komatsu Mining, and I am currently doing research with professor Keith LeGrand in the Purdue Department of Aeronautical and Astronautica Engineering. I have extracurricular experience leading a philosophy club, as well as working on liquid and hybrid rocket engines for Purdue Space Program and leading one of the top FIRST robotics teams in the world.
